I'm just starting to learn. There are too many paths, too many options. I noticed that some of them are not really essential. One could skip these things, and learn it when they're free. Some of them include;

- Keyboard layouts. There are too many options. Writing speed is important, but writing should be fun too. I come across with Dvorak, Colemak, QGMLWB and many others.
- Editors. Emacs (Spacemacs), Vi (Neovim), Ed, Sed and modern, GUI approaches like VS Code (Codium), Atom, Kate and others.
- Version control systems. Learning and using one of them is important but there are too many options.
- Spaces vs tabs. I prefer tabs. But I also use spaces. In both cases, I only touch TAB, and my editor do the rest for me.

What's really important? I want to produce something. To produce, I have to understand. I will also learn many things while trying to produce. So, I will be either;

Learning

- Reading books
- Applying tutorials
- Writing tutorials

or Working

- Recreating programs I already use
- Contributing to projects I use
- My own ideas

It might be not much, but it's enough to keep everything organized, for now.
