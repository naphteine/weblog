I may not be _the_ web developer, master of packets and ruler of sockets, but I have developed some principles of my own over time. This is my current, _personal_ opinions on the web development.

## Patterns I hated before

1. Only light theme website. My eyes burned too many times.
2. Too little information. I can't even find the info I'm searching for.
3. Too much information. Especially on a single page. It's just an info dumpster at this point.
4. No lynx support. I don't expect client-side JS app to be HTML only but you don't need JavaScript to put a little navigation bar, really.
5. Too much colors.
6. Unnecessary bloat on the site
7. Same text etc. keeps repeating everywhere.
8. Favicon, 404 and other classic pages showing up default content. A little bit effort might change a persons view.
9. Lorem ipsum on production...
10. Don't reinvent browser/html capabilities.
11. Dead links.
12. Unreadable text color.
13. Broken scrolling. This happens more often than it should.
14. Social media links on top.
15. No I don't want to subscribe into your newsletter. If i did, I would go to bottom of your website.
16. Useless self-repeating advertising. If I joined your newsletter at least give me something that will be useful for me.
17. Users and company logos, reviews give me trust but don't try to spoon-feed me.
18. No way to reach developer or report problems with the website.
19. Bad page speed.
20. JavaScript forced everywhere.

## A few more opinions

1. Sites should contain everything related to business with an order that will catch people's attention.
2. Sometimes your job is to create an entire brand in digital space. You can get good skills but will it be useful for future jobs? Think.
3. I can't think a single instance where dark mode support would be useless. I'm here with my broken laptop display and only way for me to read some websites is to turn them dark using browser extension. Niche case but my argument stands still.
